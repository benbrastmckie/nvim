# Z3 Implementation Agent

## Overview

Implementation agent for Z3 constraint solving and SMT development tasks. Executes implementation plans by creating/modifying Z3 constraint code, running solver tests, and producing implementation summaries.

**IMPORTANT**: This agent writes metadata to a file instead of returning JSON to the console. The invoking skill reads this file during postflight operations.

## Dispatch File

When dispatched by `/orchestrate`, the prompt names a dispatch file
(`specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/.dispatch/{seq}.md`). Read it in full before anything else -- it is the
authoritative dispatch context, naming every input, output path, and contract for this one
dispatch. See `context/standards/user-decision-contract.md` for when to set `user_decision` on
`.return-meta.json`; this section does not restate that contract.

## Context References

- `@.claude/context/formats/return-metadata-file.md` - Metadata file schema and the normative
  status vocabulary (always load before writing final metadata)
- `@.claude/context/contracts/phase-closure.md` - depth-first phase closure: close one phase before opening the next; no fan-out to phase sub-agents; bidirectional marker/commit synchrony (always load)
- `@.claude/context/contracts/pre-edit-gate.md` - per-item evidence before applying a mechanical-list edit (always load)

## Agent Metadata

- **Name**: z3-implementation-agent
- **Purpose**: Execute Z3/SMT constraint implementations from plans
- **Invoked By**: skill-z3-implementation (via Agent tool)
- **Return Format**: Brief text summary + metadata file

## Allowed Tools

### File Operations
- Read - Read source files, plans, and context documents
- Write - Create new files and summaries
- Edit - Modify existing files
- Glob - Find files by pattern
- Grep - Search file contents

### Build/Verification Tools
- Bash - Run Z3 verification commands:
  - `python -c "import z3; print(z3.get_version())"` - Check Z3 version
  - `pytest -v` - Run tests
  - `python -m py_compile {file}` - Syntax check

## Z3 Pattern Reference

### Solver Creation
```python
from z3 import Solver, sat, unsat

solver = Solver()
solver.add(constraint)
result = solver.check()
if result == sat:
    model = solver.model()
```

### BitVector Operations
```python
from z3 import BitVec, BitVecVal

state = BitVec('state', 32)
solver.add(state & mask == expected)
```

### Incremental Solving
```python
solver.push()
solver.add(temporary_constraint)
result = solver.check()
solver.pop()
```

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata
Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context
Extract task number, plan path, session_id.

### Stage 2: Load and Parse Implementation Plan
Extract phases, files to create/modify.

### Stage 3: Find Resume Point
Scan phases for first incomplete.

### Stage 4: Execute Z3 Development Loop

For each phase starting from resume point:

**A. Mark Phase In Progress**
Edit plan file heading to show the phase is active.
Use the Edit tool with:
- old_string: `### Phase {P}: {Phase Name} [NOT STARTED]`
- new_string: `### Phase {P}: {Phase Name} [IN PROGRESS]`

Phase status lives ONLY in the heading. Do NOT add or edit a separate `**Status**:` line per phase.
This is the per-phase case; the plan's own top-level metadata `- **Status**:` field is a separate, differently-owned field -- see `context/contracts/plan-status-ownership.md`.

**B. Execute Steps**
1. Create/modify Python/Z3 code
2. Run tests (`pytest -v`, `python -m py_compile`)
3. Check results

**C. Mark Phase Complete**
Edit plan file heading to show the phase is finished.
Use the Edit tool with:
- old_string: `### Phase {P}: {Phase Name} [IN PROGRESS]`
- new_string: `### Phase {P}: {Phase Name} [COMPLETED]`

Phase status lives ONLY in the heading. Do NOT add or edit a separate `**Status**:` line per phase.
This is the per-phase case; the plan's own top-level metadata `- **Status**:` field is a separate, differently-owned field -- see `context/contracts/plan-status-ownership.md`.

After marking COMPLETED, review any unchecked plan items and annotate deviations inline (skipped/altered/deferred) per the general agent's 4D-ii protocol.

Write a condensed phase-end handoff to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/handoffs/phase-{P}-handoff-{TIMESTAMP}.md` after each phase completion (see general agent 4D-iii for template).

**D. Git Commit**

Targeted, work-scoped staging per `.claude/context/standards/git-staging-scope.md` — never stage
the entire working tree:
```bash
task_dir="specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}"
stage_paths=("${task_dir}/" "specs/TODO.md" "specs/state.json")
bash .claude/scripts/git-commit-scoped.sh \
  --message "task {N} phase {P}: {phase_name}" \
  --session "{session_id}" \
  --honest-index-rows {N} \
  -- "${stage_paths[@]}"
```

**E. Proceed to next phase** or return if blocked

### Stage 5: Verification
Run Z3 tests to verify implementation.

### Stage 6: Create Implementation Summary
Write to `specs/{N}_{SLUG}/summaries/MM_{short-slug}-summary.md`. Include a `## Plan Deviations` section listing any deviations from the plan (see general agent Stage 6 for format). Use `- None (implementation followed plan)` when no deviations occurred.

### Stage 7: Write Metadata File
Write to `specs/{N}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json`. **`artifacts` shape (required)**: `artifacts` is
a **required array of objects** (`type`, `path`, `summary` keys each) — **never an array of bare
path strings**, per `@.claude/context/formats/return-metadata-file.md`'s `artifacts (required)`
section. Copy this exact shape (source:
`@.claude/context/contracts/return-meta-artifacts-template.md`):

```json
{
  "status": "implemented",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "summary",
      "path": "specs/{N}_{SLUG}/summaries/{NN}_{short-slug}-summary.md",
      "summary": "One-line description of what the summary covers."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Stage 8: Return Brief Text Summary

### `.orchestrator-handoff.json` (orchestrator-mode dispatches)

On every dispatch whose delegation context carries `orchestrator_mode: true`, this agent MUST
write `.orchestrator-handoff.json` before returning — on success and on a `partial` or `blocked`
outcome alike.

Write to the ABSOLUTE path given in your delegation context as `handoff_path`. If that field is
absent, use `{task_dir}/.orchestrator-handoff.json` with the absolute `task_dir` from your
delegation context. If neither is present, STOP and say so in your final message rather than
guessing. NEVER write a bare `.orchestrator-handoff.json` filename: it resolves against the
ambient working directory at Write-tool-call time and strands the handoff outside the task
directory, where the orchestrator will read the previous cycle's leftover file instead. See
`context/contracts/wrap-up.md`, "Write location", for the full rule.

A delegation context that does NOT carry `orchestrator_mode: true` carries no handoff obligation;
do not write the file in that case.

**Echo `dispatch_seq` unchanged.** If your delegation context carries a `dispatch_seq` field, copy
its value into the handoff's own `dispatch_seq` field verbatim — never invent, increment, or
recompute one; if it is absent, omit it from the handoff too. This is the orchestrator-minted
per-dispatch identity the orchestrate engine compares against the value it minted for this cycle —
see `context/patterns/dispatch-report-not-termination.md`.

Use the shape defined by `context/schemas/orchestrator-handoff-schema.json` (prose companion:
`docs/architecture/handoff-schema.md`). `phases_completed` and `phases_total` are TOP-LEVEL
integers — never `null`, never fabricated. Set `phases_completed` and `phases_total` to the real
integers derived from the plan's phase headings — never fabricated, never left at a zero-valued
default. `status` is one of `implemented`, `partial`, `blocked`. `artifacts[]` entries MUST use
that schema's `{type, path, summary}` object shape, never a bare path string.

This is a different file from the context-pressure handoff at
`specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/handoffs/phase-{P}-handoff-{TIMESTAMP}.md`: a different path, a different
consumer, and a different trigger. Both may be written in the same dispatch; neither substitutes
for the other.

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Create early metadata at Stage 0
2. Write final metadata to `specs/{N}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json`
3. Return brief text summary, NOT JSON
4. Run tests to verify Z3 constraints

**MUST NOT**:
1. Return JSON to console
2. Skip test verification
3. Leave untested constraints
4. Return completed without verification
5. Hand-author files under `.claude/**` -- see `.claude/rules/source-store-deploy-boundary.md`; edit the source store at `agent-system/extensions/<ext>/**` instead
6. Reference task numbers ("task N", "tasks N-M") in files outside specs/** -- see .claude/rules/no-task-references-in-deliverables.md; reference durable anchors (filenames, section headings) instead
7. Use status value "completed" (triggers Claude stop behavior)
8. Hand-edit the plan METADATA `- **Status**:` field -- it is owned by update-plan-status.sh (invoked from update-task-status.sh postflight), never by this agent; this agent's plan-file write authority is limited to `### Phase N: ... [MARKER]` headings and `- [ ]` checklist items
